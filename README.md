** Paucituberculata is the only extant mammal order yet without a genome! The extant marsupial family Caenolestidae (shrew-opossums) is represented by 7 species in the Andes mountains of South America.

### Summary of genomes by attributes 
- body size (adult average body mass of sequenced species; modified from Faurby and Svenning 2016 http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/686268)
- latitude (absolute value of centroid of species geographic range polygon; modified from IUCN 2016 https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download)

| variable           | med   | low95 | up95    | low50 | up50  |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| Body mass (all)    | 0.08  | 0.00  | 180.39  | 0.02  | 0.63  |
| Body mass (genome) | 2.07  | 0.01  | 2392.26 | 0.08  | 22.42 |
| Latitude (all)     | 15.35 | 0.52  | 52.44   | 5.87  | 28.06 |
| Latitude (genome)  | 22.30 | 0.64  | 58.69   | 8.39  | 34.90 |

 * Wilcoxon rank sum tests with continuity correction:  
 	- Body mass: W = 1150239, p-value < 2.2e-16
	- Latitude: W = 1404678, p-value = 3.09e-14
 			
### Summary of the Zoonomia 241-way alignment

* 239 species (241 taxa) in the Zoonomia Consortium alignment
	- "A total of 242 genome assemblies, representing 240 species, are included in the Zoonomia Cactus alignment. We included all non-redundant, high-quality assemblies posted on NCBI for >6 months as of March 3, 2018, or for a shorter time if an associated publication was available. One species (dog) is represented by two genomes. Due to a technical error, one genome available on NCBI (Tarsius_syrichta-2.0.1) was not included in this initial alignment, and the genome for Dipodomys stephensi was represented twice."
	- So, 241 species in the alignment V2 on UCSC: https://cglgenomics.ucsc.edu/data/cactus/
	- Of these, 2 are redundant at the species level (_Canis lupus dingo_, _Ceratotherium simum cottoni_) == 239 species
		+ 121 species were newly generated by Zoonomia, published in 2019
		+ 118 species were aligned from RefSeq
